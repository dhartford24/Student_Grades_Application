# Student_Grades_Application

Designed a program written in Java to help teachers easily calculate grades for their students.  Given an input file with quiz and test scores from an unknown amount of students, the program is able to determine letter grades for each student, average test and quiz scores for each student, and determine the minimum and maximum scores for each test and quiz.  This data is then written and saved to an output file.
